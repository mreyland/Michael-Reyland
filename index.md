## Welcome to my profile

I am currently taking this course as part of a Bachelor of Business (Logistics and SCM major) through RMIT. I have two units to complete after this unit so looking forward to getting it all wrapped up.  
I'm married with two kids aged 2 and 4 and currently employed as Superintendent of Rail Operations for a large Iron Ore Mining company in Western Australia.  
I was born and raised in NZ before moving to Perth about 12 years ago. The only language I speak is English, however I did once try to learn Japanese but very quickly realised I was not linguistically gifted.  
A couple of interesting facts:
1. I have flown so many times for work that I now have lifetime gold membership
2. I have spent my entire working career in the mining industry
3. At 36 years of age I appear to be having a mid-life crisis and have started tackling events like half-ironmans, long distance oceans swims and also climbed Mt. Kilamanjaro with my wife.
