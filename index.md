## Welcome to my profile
  
- Name: Michael Reyland  
- Student ID: s3293934  
- email: s3293934@student.rmit.edu.au  
  
I am currently taking this course as part of a Bachelor of Business (Logistics and SCM major) through RMIT. I have two units to complete after this unit so looking forward to getting it all wrapped up.  
I'm married with two kids aged 2 and 4 and currently employed as Superintendent of Rail Operations for a large Iron Ore Mining company in Western Australia.  
I was born and raised in NZ before moving to Perth about 12 years ago. The only language I speak is English, however I did once try to learn Japanese but very quickly realised I was not linguistically gifted.  
A couple of interesting facts:
1. I have flown so many times for work that I now have lifetime gold membership
2. I have spent my entire working career in the mining industry
3. At 36 years of age I appear to be having a mid-life crisis and have started tackling events like half-ironmans, long distance oceans swims and also climbed Mt. Kilamanjaro with my wife.  
  
### Interest in IT  
  
My key interest in IT presently is further exploring ways that I can leverage IT to make my current role more effective through improving the performance of the Rail network. My interest in IT has not neccessarily started in the last 3-4 years, however it has certainly increased over this period as I have seen firsthand how beneficial timley analysis of all available data can help me improve performance.  
Historically I have made educated guesses as to which areas to focus on to improve performance, whereas now most decisions are supported by analysis of a range of key inputs. The way our team now creates various dashboards through applications such as Spotfire puts all the data at our fingertips in an easy to interpret view.  
My experience with IT involves the daily use of everyday tools such as emails and more recently the use of dashboards and company ERP's such as SAP.  
I chose to study at RMIT as the field of study I am interested in is Logistics and SCM and RMIT at the time were the only provider that offered that specific major. I needed the flexibility of online study as I work full-time with most work weeks well over 60+ hours, therefore finding time can be difficult.  
During my studies in this unit I would expect to get a brief introduction to a range of key IT fields that are shaping industry / personal fields. I also expect we would touch on some of the IT ideas that may influence / disrupt our way of life in the future.
