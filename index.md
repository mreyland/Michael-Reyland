## Welcome to my profile
  
- Name: Michael Reyland  
- Student ID: s3293934  
- email: s3293934@student.rmit.edu.au  
  
I am currently taking this course as part of a Bachelor of Business (Logistics and SCM major) through RMIT. I have two units to complete after this unit so looking forward to getting it all wrapped up.  
I'm married with two kids aged 2 and 4 and currently employed as Superintendent of Rail Operations for a large Iron Ore Mining company in Western Australia.  
I was born and raised in NZ before moving to Perth about 12 years ago. The only language I speak is English, however I did once try to learn Japanese but very quickly realised I was not linguistically gifted.  
A couple of interesting facts:
1. I have flown so many times for work that I now have lifetime gold membership
2. I have spent my entire working career in the mining industry
3. At 36 years of age I appear to be having a mid-life crisis and have started tackling events like half-ironmans, long distance oceans swims and also climbed Mt. Kilamanjaro with my wife.  
  
### Interest in IT  
  
My key interest in IT presently is further exploring ways that I can leverage IT to make my current role more effective through improving the performance of the Rail network. My interest in IT has not neccessarily started in the last 3-4 years, however it has certainly increased over this period as I have seen firsthand how beneficial timley analysis of all available data can help me improve performance.  
Historically I have made educated guesses as to which areas to focus on to improve performance, whereas now most decisions are supported by analysis of a range of key inputs. The way our team now creates various dashboards through applications such as Spotfire puts all the data at our fingertips in an easy to interpret view.  
My experience with IT involves the daily use of everyday tools such as emails and more recently the use of dashboards and company ERP's such as SAP.  
I chose to study at RMIT as the field of study I am interested in is Logistics and SCM and RMIT at the time were the only provider that offered that specific major. I needed the flexibility of online study as I work full-time with most work weeks well over 60+ hours, therefore finding time can be difficult.  
During my studies in this unit I would expect to get a brief introduction to a range of key IT fields that are shaping industry / personal fields. I also expect we would touch on some of the IT ideas that may influence / disrupt our way of life in the future.

### Project Idea

#### Overview
  
An IT project idea that I believe would be very beneficial for my team would be the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) to locate cattle struck by trains as soon as possible. Currently if cattle are struck by our trains, we send team members to the location to track down the injured animal so that it can be euthanised as quickly as possible. In some instances the terrain is difficult to access by vehicle and in some instances team members are required to walk in rough terrain. This is especially risky when working on night shift.

#### Motivation
  
By using UAV's, the cattle could likely be located faster and therefore in situations where the animal needs to be euthanised, we can complete the task as quickly as possible ultimately reducing the timeframe the animal suffers. An addition benefit is that our team members are not required to access rough terrain on foot, which reduces the likelihood of personal injury. There would also be production benefits associated as we currently halt operations on the track until the struck cattle can be found. If we are able to find the animal quicker, then we would be able to recommence operations sooner.
  
#### Description
  
The UAV would need to be small enough that is could easily be transported by one or two people and in the tray of a standard 4WD vehicle. The UAV would need to have a suitable range of flight appropriate to the areas that may require searching. Given the vastness of some of the rail locations, a flight time of up to one hour would help to ensure that the UAV can stay flying long enough to locate the animal.   
  
Whilst range is important, there are some strict aviation guidelines that do stipulate that a pilot of a UAV does need to maintain visual contact with the UAV at all times. Being a large coorporation it will be important that we comply with all aviation regulations. We would also require enough UAV's strategically located across the rail network so that our team members do not need to travel long distances to source one. The rail network is over 1600kms long therefore analysis would need to be conducted to determine the most ideal locations to store UAV's.  
  
The process would be:  
1. Radio contact is made with rail supervisors to advise of possible impact with wildlife  
2. Supervisors contact the rail team members in the most suitable location  
3. Rail team members collect UAV and travel to approximate impact area  
4. If animal is not visible from the road, operators use UAV to scan the area  
5. Once animal is found, operators take GPS coordinates and organise for the appropriate management of the animal  
  
  
#### Tool and Technologies  
  
The most obvious tool is the UAV itself with batteries and appropriate controller that has the required range. Additionally, the UAV with have to be kitted out with a high quality camera that provides images back to the controller. Given the increased difficulty with locating animals during the hours of darkness, it would be very useful if the UAV was also equipped with infra-red or heat seeking camera technology to further improve the chances of locating the animal. Our rail operators are not always able to manage the struck animals once they have been located, therefore the UAV would also need the ability to be able to take accurate GPS readings that could then be sent to any external parties that we need to engage.  
  
#### Skills Required  
  
In accordance with national regulations, any operators of UAV's for commercial purposes need to complete relevant UAV licenses. Our business also has an internal training and competency package that has been developed for use specifically in the mining environment. The scope of this training could be broadened to include use near main roads and possibly airports as sections of our rail network come within close proximity. The operators would need to maintain a log book of flights to maintain annual competency.  
  
#### Outcome  
  
If implemented properly, this technology could improve the welfare of animals that come in contact with rolling stock through more efficient management of their conditions. It could also reduce the risk of team members getting injured whilst trying to locate injured animals in rough terrain and during the hours of darkness.  
  
Additionally, if the technology is successful then there could also be related production benefits that would greatly outweigh the costs associated with setting it all up.
